About me
======

Hi! I am Benjamin Jauregui, a second year PhD student at Universidad de Chile. My main line of research is the study of discrete problems in modern model of computing, such as parallel and distributed computing. My advisors are Ivan Rapaport and Pedro Montealegre.

During my Master, I also worked developing distributed verification algorithms for recognizing several geometric graph classes.

Besides my main line of research, I am interested in diverse topics: The intersection of distributed primitives in other areas, such as blockchain and cryptography, how to apply distributed computing in practice and the model and simulation of economical/mathematical problems in Julia.
