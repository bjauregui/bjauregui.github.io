Hi! I am Benjamin Jauregui, a second year PhD student at Universidad de Chile. My main line of research is distributed computing, where I have been working exploring how to implement classical schemes from centralized algorithms to improve the deterministic distributed solution of hard distributed problemas, such as DFS construction or maximum matching. My advisors are Ivan Rapaport and Pedro Montealegre.

During my Master, I also worked developing distributed algorithms but aiming to recognize different geometric graph classes, such as permutation graphs, trapezoid graphs, etc.

Besides my main line of research, I am interested in various topics: How to apply distributed computing in practice,  model and solve mathematical problems in Julia, and the intersection of distributed primitives in other areas, such as blockchain and cryptography.
